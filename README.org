* Research-Weekly-Report-Template

** Structure

The report is divided in sections, one latex file per section.
The file =report.tex= is the main file and includes all the latex files.
If you know at least a bit of latex, you should understand everything in less than 30 seconds by just looking at the source files.


** How to use

- Copy the file =Makefile.example= to =Makefile=. Edit if necessary.
- Use =make= to compile the source files and generate the =.pdf= file.
- If needed clean the workspace with the command =make clean=.
